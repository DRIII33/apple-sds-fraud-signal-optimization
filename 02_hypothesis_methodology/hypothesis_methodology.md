# Phase 2: Hypothesis & Methodology

## Hypothesis
Apple Walletâ€™s fraud detection system overflags legitimate transactions due to insufficient signal granularity. Enriching the pipeline with behavioral, temporal, and merchant-level features will improve precision and recall.

## Methodology
1. Feature Engineering
2. Label Validation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Signal Modeling Strategy
5. Operational Impact Simulation

## Feature Targets
- hour_of_day
- transaction_day
- merchant_risk_score
- user_velocity_index
- device_risk_factor
- channel_risk_profile
- foreign_night_combo
